who was raped. Every candidate has flaws. Obviously Johnson will not win, 
but that's not why I'm voting for him. I'm voting for him to send a 
message! I want actual candidates to vote for!

Hillary's ideas of a higher minimum wage and a debt free college are 
unrealistic. Higher minimum wage will only cause inflation and cause the 
value of the US dollar to go down. Minimum wage is just that! Minimum wage, 
it's for entry level positions such as fast food. You will see higher pay 
if you actually applied yourself. So sit your whining asses down! You're 
not looking or applying yourself hard enough! Quit trying to get everything 
handed to you! Debt free college is unrealistic. I don't want my tax money 
to go help a student go to college and flunk out of remedial classes 
because they messed up back in high school or where ever they were 
educated. That's unrealistic, which removes Jill Stein from the equation.

Trump's idea on abortion and gay marriage are too old fashioned for the 
America we have today. Maybe work on the adoption programs and foster care 
we have in place before worrying about being against abortion. He sounds 
like a complete idiot. He'll run America like a business and not like a 
country.

our politicians. Trump is most likely right. The differences is that 
opponents did not like hearing those words from his mouth. And HIllary 
mentioned that Bias is a systemic and national problem in our country which 
is true also. I did not watch this debate live. Although most political 
experts deemed Hillary the winner from this debate, this 1st debate seemed 
to be much more civil than the 2nd and 3rd debates. Both candidates spoke 
well on some topics in regards to police training & racial bias. They 
weren't actually going at each other's throats on those topics. Trump had 
major points about government instability. He did nail it in regards to the 
costs and charging of spending. When I was in the Army, I had to perform 
something called PMCS checks on a Humvee assigned to me. And it nearly took 
a year and a half to receive the chains ordered for the hummer assigned to 
me. I and my fellow soldiers would scratch our heads on why something so 
mundane as chains for tires took so long to order? There could have been 
other factors too such as leadership above us dragging their feet within 
our ""chain of command"" submitting the order. Trust me when I say this, I'm 
proud to be a veteran in the US Army, but at least the Army that I was 
assigned to often did not get the job done in an expedient manner. I'm just 
telling it like it is. I'm sure other branches of service may have similar 
experiences about the virtual bureaucratic red tape that exists within all 
forms of the military and federal government. Our leadership could have 
thrown money together in a pot and bought chains at a local auto parts 
store for some tires needed to complete our inventories. But that was of 
course considered illegal because the chains that the government 
must approve of all certified parts and must go through proper channels. 
Which is agreeable. But again, there is no excuse that such a mundane part 
should have taken so long to order. Just my two cents on some of us in the 
military feeling the brunt of government inefficiency at that time. I'm

228,"Everyone's so worried about Donald Trump causing another world war with 
some other country, but seeing that him and Putin are on friendly terms, 
there's a very unlikely chance that a nuclear war or a similar war decades 
ago will reoccur. That's how I see it right now. And if in fact a war does 
break out, then it won't be a problem for America, taking in consideration 
about how advanced our military technology is and our allies, which are 
superpowers in this world. Trump is a bully and bigot. His behavior is at 
times unacceptable, and I dislike how he expresses his ideas. However, I 
believe, as a Republican and a Christian, that his campaign is not 
outrageous nor is it worse than Clinton's. He is also very clean when it 
comes to politics because he has no previous affiliations with politicians. 
However, being a main factor is why people voted for Clinton, her extensive 
background in politics makes her more vulnerable to having to put interest 
to her 'fellow' politicians if she won the election. Her lies would become 
bigger and bigger, just like her email issues. Her view on social issues 
clash greatly with mine, and I think that was a major factor in the 
reasoning of why I support Trump. These days, social issues are a huge deal 
to many people and the sensitivity to it has increased dramatically. 
Although Trump is a man who was never affiliated with politics/military and 
is solely a business man, you could obviously tell by the results of this 
election that he prudently calculated the probability of him winning, which 
was a main reason in his decision to run. Also, many people claim Trump is 
'gay'. Seeing that a) they insult him based on his sexuality or made-up 
sexuality b) they look down on him because of how is reported to be 'gay', 
they aren't fit to be a supporter of both the Democrat or Republican side. 
These hypocrites (Clinton supporters) who slam him down because they think 
he is homosexual is going against what the Democrats sought for: accepting 
everyone, whether or not they're gay or lesbian, transgender, a minority or 
Caucasian, etc.. These sorts of nonsense commentary about him and his 
personal life doesn't affect anyone, but just degrades the anonymous users 
behind these computer screens because of their seemingly uneducated 
background by using that type of diction. I think I covered most of the 
reasons why I support Trump and his campaign to #makeamericagreatagain. I 
hope those who read this will respect my opinion, and will take it into 
consideration before talking smack about Trump again. Thank you and let's 
see what America has in store for everyone. Good night.",0.214914127288,-0.0629567171246

up with Trump
Is that is very vague in his answers leaving it open to perception and 
people can set them selves up to a false outcome

One thing im noticing his on about slashing taxes, but then his on about 
policing the streets with stop and search

Taxes help pay for public services (Well thats how it works in the UK, and 
I would imagine its the same if not similar in the US) so how do you reduce 
the government income to then say hey, we now going to milk the pot by 
putting police on the streets doing stop and searches) which risks 
segregation.

You have this strerotype that black men from ""Hoods"" or poor neighborhoods 
are heavily involved in armed crime (such as the cribs vs bloods) now I am 
not saying every black male does this so please dont twist my words, but I 
am saying if this stereotype exists you will get a lot of people being 
unnecessarily frisked, this will cause people to feel oppressed by the 
police and where this is still fresh in the black community specially since 
they havent let the whole Rodney King incident lie and that was over 25 yrs 
ago, 

Whilst previously I was a trump supporter just out of ludicracy and seing a 
change
If i was to be serious for a moment, I feel trump will be negative for the 
US

Not saying Hilliary is perfect look at the Email scandal, but she has the 
mannerism is more professional and more suited to the role that Trump, its 
just a shame its boiled down to therse two canditates for the US,

Some may argue whats it to do with the UK.
The USA is a powerhouse, its one of the largest bodies and influencial 
countries in the world and a lot of political decisions that take place in 
the US eventually affect other countries

I dont think it will be as dramatic as some people make out when 
interviewing the general public on the news, there will always be advisors 
the president has and the last thing you want is to anger the people you 
serve as they can turn on you, history shows this

Presidents have been known to have been assasenated, so i dont think for a 
moment it will cause the end of the world, but i dont think some of their 
decisions wont be detrimental to people ie Wars in syria or russia with no 
fly zones, or breaking the american bank and make america fall into further 
debt, poverty, crime will increase etc and wars can break out between other 
countries such as Mexico and its alies

Not sure if it would play out like that but I guess we will find out after

about politics the only reason I am voting is
to keep hillary clinton out of the white house. due to her mishandling of 
classified information, her taking massive amounts of
money from corporate backers, due to her sociopathic use of accusations of 
sexual misconduct against her opponent while having silenced multiple 
victims of sexual assault in the past when it suited her, her pulling money 
out of her foundation that
was intended to help people she insist's are going to be oppressed by her 
opponents, as well a large number of people who were supposed to testify 
against her have turned up dead and the fact she will likely start ww3 with 
russia I would have to say for me this election is about the morality of 
the candidates and don't misunderstand I don't think donald trump is an 
angel 
but even though I am a libertarian I would sacrifice every political view I 
have to keep that warmongering sociopath out of the white house I WOULD 
HAVE VOTED FOR BERNIE SANDERS OVER HER AND HE AND I DONT AGREE ON ANYTHING.
I feel sorry for american democrats that this wretched woman managed to 
sabotage bernies bid for the democratic nomination
as while I don't agree with his politics I wouldn't have bothered to vote 
against him since I think he is just a human with 
different political views then me and not actually a bad person (at least 
by politician standards) this woman stole your dnc nomination, she has 
silenced victims of sexual assault when it suited her, she breaks the laws 
of this country whenever she wants, is in the pocket of numerous corporate 
backers, is suspected though not proven guilty by myself and others of 
having people who testify against her killed, has been disgustingly 
contempt filled towards her own supporters in her emails,and people who 
work for her HAVE BEEN CAUGHT ON VIDEO admitting to voter fraud, and 
inciting violence at trump rallies.
AND TO TOP IT ALL OFF she is attempting actions that could spark a third 
world war. american liberals I implore you please
do not vote for this women she doesn't care about you,she has galvanized 
your opposition in this race,she has stolen your nomination from you, shown 
contempt for you,and lied to you. I understand fully your dislike of donald 
trump on both a personal level as he is brash and vulgar and on a political 
level I will never fault you for disagreeing with me or mister trump 
about political issues but the worst the man will do deregulate american 
business and make it difficult to immigrate to this country hillary will 
start a world war please don't let this sociopath play you. sanders or 
someone else can be elected on the
next go around but we have to have not been nuked in the next four years

789,"Peaple you are correct about them. I know something that would shock the 
world. The Antichrist gave them a extra power to there own power that would 
floor you. I have Proof and i cannot explain how but i can say allot about 
it. The Power gave to the Queen by the Antichrist is Youth and other things 
with it. The Antichrist has shocking power inside him to keep peaple alive 
wile torchoring peaple for years and to give Youth to anyone. The 
Antichrist can remove Deadly illeness out of anyone and give it to anyone. 
Antichrist is very evil and i think you all know why? Who is the devil? 
Hint? What power in the Devil is possable in the years of the Antichrist. 
They can do anything and i am not kidding around they can walk through 
walls stand around were you cannot see them. Home privacy is invaded in 
mean manners you are being watched in the bathroom at home in your bedroom 
at home. Your being laughed at! The Royals are not so nice and not anymore. 
There is allot more to this power. The Queen goes out in public looking 
normal and in secret privacy not even peaple that work for her knows. There 
could be a few workers that have agreed the secret or elce. She looks young 
with her Husband. She is way different looking than her young adult years. 
We are talking bigger Breast and a body women dream about. The other Royals 
have taken some of these powers to secretly look better to advance there 
looks. They were given energy to stay awake at all hours of the night also. 
The Antichrist can here peaple in the worlds thinking. There know what you 
think at all times the Queen also took that on With her Husband. They think 
evil thoughts about the peaple in the world along with this Antichrist. The 
Antichrist has been here for years and be honest with yourselfs and ask 
yourself when was this mark given to you years ago. Do anyone of you 
remember a strange males voice in your homes asking you if you were a 
christian?! That was the Antichrist. He would keep asking until you gave a 
awnser and it made you scared maby, confused maby. When you said no that 
you were not a Christian, Guess what? You got marked by Satan from the 
Antichrist. It happend! They did this to the world quick and sneaky for 
most peaple in the world. The high power leaders communicate with him. The 
world is now a sick evil joke and some of the High power leaders is in 
pretend mode with humans with some stuff they do. There lives are easy in 
ways and they live off powers to have more fun it's like better than a 
fairytail for them. our leaders are pulling your chain now! They will 
always make things look normal in front of your faces and your hearing. 
They gave Vanity and great bodies to certain peaple and we are talking 
major Vanity here. Satan is evil in Vanity issues and it happend through 
the Antichrist! There was a deal made with these select high power peaple 
from the Antichrist and he gave them this Vanity and energy and knowledge 
more than anyone could understand. They are up wile the world sleeps! They 
trully don't care about you. It is not just the peaple torchoring that they 
hate it is everyone in the world. They care for there family but there not 
so concerned about you. The Antichrist Hates all Human peaple in this

1005,"My point of view about this debate:
1) I think there should be some other candidate for President. It sounded 
both were just roasting each other. 
Instead of talking about the country they are just talking about each other.
2) Plans of trump like cutting Tax is very good. Because in long run this 
will work if we study this 
system properly, it answers itself. Because cutting tax will get jobs back 
and addition to few more plans that will
bring more jobs, makes it perfect. Even though Hillary thinks other way 
round pointing towards middle class but 
the number of jobs it will make is less than the jobs that will be lost. 
Also cutting tax to wealthy class or 
business people should come with constraints of employment to automatically 
concentrate on the whole countries 
financial issue and employment. Also investments and concentration on 
Research and development, innovation and small 
business will lead to increase in employment.
3) Race Question: It can be done by giving equal opportunities to all races 
and legally taking action against 
those who discriminate. And create a community, having all races as 
employees in every sector, who will manage all the 
complaints related to race, which will be answered directly by the 
President and will run independently. And this community 
should be easily accessible. Educational system should also be targeted to 
teach kids to help remove race discrimination. 
Because the knowledge and habits at the early age is more effective. 
Problem of races is problem of all countries so the 
above things I mentioned is good at Presidential level but this is actual 
work of everyone of us.

believe in her good side, I must say that after just recently having looked 
into the rape case Donald mentions here in which she indeed successfully 
defended a rapist and got him off the hook although she knew that he was 
guilty, I find that to be the most important and convincing reason to speak 
against her as a person and most importantly speaks against her as being a 
politician. I'm not saying there isn't enough that speaks against the same 
things in Trump's case. 
But standing there and calling him out on something he's supposed to 
apologise for (he definitely is!) while at the same time not having the 
mere guts to apologise to the rape victim is just such a low of character, 
I don't have any words for that.
I may not be an American citizen so I don't actually have a say in that but 
as a human being I am just sick and tired of this kind of politicians.

husbands, muslims can have multiple women, they can beat their women, their 
women have to cover themselves up when going in public, they have less 
rights and they ALWAYS have to obey their husbands.

Rape is something very common in the islam, why do you think there are so 
many European women and girls getting raped? Because in the eyes of 
muslims, women are inferior and they treat our women the same way as they 
treat their own women, which results in so much rape and not even half of 
all the rapes are reported.

Islam MUST BE driven out of Europe and America. Not even 20% of the entire 
world population is white so stop the race-mixing by accepting 
multiculturalism. Multiculturalism does not work, multiple cultures 
together does not work, there will always be problems when there is

1816,"Is Russia messing with our election in an effort to get Donald Trump into 
the White House?

The answer is yes.

Trump has repeatedly dismissed the possibility. ""She has no idea whether
it's Russia, China or anybody else,"" the Republican nominee said during
the final presidential debate when Hillary Clinton stated that Russian 
President Vladimir Putin was behind the hacking of Democratic National 
Committee emails. He added: ""Hillary, you have no idea.""
Clinton did have an idea -- the Democratic nominee was correct to point 
the finger at Russia. And Trump, who had received a 
classified briefing on the subject, knew it.
""The U.S. Intelligence Community is confident that the Russian 
Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from U.S. persons 
and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations,"" the 
Department of Homeland Security and the National Intelligence director's
office said in a statement the first week of October. They added:
""These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the U.S. 
election process.""
Now, less than a week before Election Day, it's becoming 
clear that Russia isn't satisfied with stealing and disseminating email 
from Democratic Party groups. It looks likely our former Cold War 
adversary is also creating counterfeit documents to support Trump's 
baseless claim that the election system is ""rigged"" against him.
""The FBI and U.S. intelligence agencies are examining faked 
documents aimed at discrediting the Hillary Clinton campaign as part of a
broader investigation into what U.S. officials believe has been an 
attempt by Russia to disrupt the presidential election,"" Reuters 
reported on Thursday.
Among the documents that are being examined, the news 
service wrote, is a fake letter from Delaware Sen. Tom Carper, a key 
member of the Senate's Homeland Security Committee. In the letter, he 
tells Clinton he will secure the election for her. Reuters added:
In addition to the Carper letter, the FBI has also 
reviewed a seven-page electronic document that carries the logos of 
Democratic pollster Joel Benenson's firm, the Benenson Strategy Group, 
and the Clinton Foundation, a person with knowledge of the matter said.
The document, identified as a fake by the Clinton 
campaign, claims poll ratings had plunged for Clinton and called for 
""severe strategy changes for November"" that could include ""staged civil 
unrest"" and ""radiological attack"" with dirty bombs to disrupt the vote.
Some fringe right websites have already heralded the fake 
documents, presenting them as legitimate. The possibility of a Russian 
disinformation campaign, with fraudulent documents mixed in with real 
ones, is one reason the Clinton campaign has not authenticated any of 
the DNC emails that the transparency site WikiLeaks has been releasing day 
by day.",0.0159032386423,0.162979171186

even begin until almost a half hour into the video's beginning (28 minutes,

2158,"Talking about yourself in the 3d person is a characteristic of anti-social 
personality disorder (narcissism) as is feeling threatened, being unable to 
recognize your faults and shortcomings. And pathological lying (76%, 70 
times in a single speech, or every 5 minutes depending on how you count 
them). Saying the President's mother was not in the hospital is an example 
of one such lie--we have seen the guy who was born the same night as Obama 
in the same hospital. He remembers his family talking a lot about meeting 
the Obama family. 

Then we have the newspaper announcement--only the hospital can place those 
announcements. We also saw an interview with a fellow student /teacher at 
the university with Obama's parents--it was a big deal that she was 
pregnant there because students did not have babies. Then they brought the 
babies to parties. So much proof of his birth in Hawaii--yet he never will 
admit he was wrong--he just makes up new lies. 'People pouring over the 
border"" is yet another lie--illegal immigration is net zero--as many leave 
as come. He lies and lies. As is car companies stealing our business--it 
was GM's best year!

That ""unifier"" language is straight out of Hitler's M.O.--his last tactic 
after the extreme nationalism, creation of the ""other"" as the ones 
responsible for everything that's wrong in America, the blocking of 
emigration, immigration, the creation of classes of citizenship--certain 
groups must do more and get less, throwing out people with certain beliefs 
(here protected by the Constitution), marking people with insignia and even 
tattoos (I heard him suggest tattoos on the faces of Muslims), and marking 
their documents with religious affiliation/beliefs. Hitler then pivoted to 
becoming the ""unifier"" on the last Sunday in January 1933. On Tuesday I 
think it was--January 30th, the President appointed him Chancellor--he 
never acted as unifier, instead imprisoning communists (the largest 
political faction in the Reichstag (legislature) in the first concentration 
camp, Dachau. He then built 1 per quarter, then one per month and 
eventually put anyone with a hereditary illness, gypsies, homosexuals, and 
Jews inside, once the communists were gone... He transitioned them to slave 
labor camps, then set a 90 day limit on prisoners' usefulness, at which 
point they were scheduled to be dead of starvation, illness, or violence. 
Finally, full of Jews and eastern Europeans, the Final Solution was 
introduced, expanding techniques long used on mental patients and those 
born with debilitating illnesses to Jews and Eastern Europeans. Firing 
squads, gassing... Some unifier. 

Trump loves authoritarian leaders. People are always shocked by these 
rulers later, but they rarely change their stripes. They telegraph their 
intentions, tactics...they say what they like, write about it. His fans 
should wake-up. I know they hate books, studying, boring things. But grow 
up! The country is not a TV show. Go to Hollywood, take tours, go to 
tapings! Don't elect a TV reality host to the most complex, dangerous, 
powerful position on Earth, where even a thoughtless word can cause other 
rulers to invade innocent countries as Saddam has Kuwait, China has Tibet, 
and threatened Nepal and India, Japan has Korea, China and Mongolia and 
Russia has countless countries, most recently Crimea, a region of Ukraine. 
Russia is not massing tanks on Ukraine's border. 

Trump is saying he will hire such better employees to vet immigrantsa...but 
look at people he really hires--he can't even stand them more than a few 
months! It's the best example of incompetence. How would a man who never 
had a job in govt, never even worked on a city council, never even won an 
election to run the local dogpound going to suddenly hire the world's 
greatest employees, and specialists in vetting immigrants--requiring 
language abilities, cultural understanding and experience and a huge dose 
of psychology, and the kind of truth and lie identifying, straight out of 
the gate in Washington--when his days would be filled with mending fences 
with people who he dissed big time and have no reason to work with him...he 
needs them to approve his cabinet, initiatives, funding, and appointments 
to posts around the world. In addition to the full-time job of crisis 
management, diplomacy, etc. The comparison to Reagan ignores the 8 years he 
served running the 7th or 8th largest economy on Earth, the many loyal 
people who had worked for him and knew the jobs, knew the boss, knew each 
other. And he had been running for half a decade, planning planning and 
planning, as were people who supported him in the State Dept, military, 
Congress, the Attorney General... Trump has zero. ZERO. 

Seriously, Chis Christie and Mike Pence (a former radio host after all, not 
an attorney or economist, or even CEO of a big company (these family-run 
tiny businesses like W. and Trump run--where Trump hires one guy to run 
each hotel and each golf course, waiting for their reports, just do not 
count. Trump has no experience hiring on huge levels, managing law 
enforcement, prosecutors and a Justice Dept, a labor dept, the EPA he can't 
even name, the State Dept, etc etc. It's not staging contract negotiations 
because you must see these same people year after year after year. And 
Trump would have to trust and delegate entire chunks--and we've seen what 
self-serving actions these fools take when they get some power...invading 
Iraq looking for fake WMDs, without Kevlar vests on soldiers, or kevlar 
reinforcing on tanks and trucks. Cheney stole everything in the treasury 
for Halliburton--his first loyalty, and now he is a multi, multi 
millionaire...people cannot be trusted if you can't review them 
knowledgeably. 

But Trump does not know world or American history, does not know the govt, 
the world, its leaders...he really thinks aliens are ""pouring"" over the 
border....and jobs can be brought back--even tho 7 to 9 in every 10 jobs 
lost was lost to mechanization. And now China is losing its jobs to 
mechanization and to other countries who are poorer and can work cheaper 
because they live in grass huts. Trump could not learn everything he would 
need to know in a year, if he wanted to, and he has NO intellectual 
curiosity! He could not care less. Dunning Kruger Effect magnified for the 
size of his ego.

about politics the only reason I am voting is
to keep hillary clinton out of the white house. due to her mishandling of 
classified information, her taking massive amounts of
money from corporate backers, due to her sociopathic use of accusations of 
sexual misconduct against her opponent while having silenced multiple 
victims of sexual assault in the past when it suited her, her pulling money 
out of her foundation that
was intended to help people she insist's are going to be oppressed by her 
opponents, as well a large number of people who were supposed to testify 
against her have turned up dead and the fact she will likely start ww3 with 
russia I would have to say for me this election is about the morality of 
the candidates and don't misunderstand I don't think donald trump is an 
angel 
but even though I am a libertarian I would sacrifice every political view I 
have to keep that warmongering sociopath out of the white house I WOULD 
HAVE VOTED FOR BERNIE SANDERS OVER HER AND HE AND I DONT AGREE ON ANYTHING.
I feel sorry for american democrats that this wretched woman managed to 
sabotage bernies bid for the democratic nomination
as while I don't agree with his politics I wouldn't have bothered to vote 
against him since I think he is just a human with 
different political views then me and not actually a bad person (at least 
by politician standards) this woman stole your dnc nomination, she has 
silenced victims of sexual assault when it suited her, she breaks the laws 
of this country whenever she wants, is in the pocket of numerous corporate 
backers, is suspected though not proven guilty by myself and others of 
having people who testify against her killed, has been disgustingly 
contempt filled towards her own supporters in her emails,and people who 
work for her HAVE BEEN CAUGHT ON VIDEO admitting to voter fraud, and 
inciting violence at trump rallies.
AND TO TOP IT ALL OFF she is attempting actions that could spark a third 
world war. american liberals I implore you please
do not vote for this women she doesn't care about you,she has galvanized 
your opposition in this race,she has stolen your nomination from you, shown 
contempt for you,and lied to you. I understand fully your dislike of donald 
trump on both a personal level as he is brash and vulgar and on a political 
level I will never fault you for disagreeing with me or mister trump 
about political issues but the worst the man will do deregulate american 
business and make it difficult to immigrate to this country hillary will 
start a world war please don't let this sociopath play you. sanders or 
someone else can be elected on the
next go around but we have to have not been nuked in the next four years 
for that to happen PLEASE don't vote for her.

2390,"I will never understand how people can say some of the things being said 
throughout this election. No matter who you choose to vote for, it is not 
right to say any of the candidates should commit suicide or be murdered. It 
is also very silly to assume that World War III is going to breakout due to 
the results of this election, or that this country is headed towards the 
apocalypse. With that being said though, Donald Trump is the best candidate 
we could vote for, because otherwise, our country will be worse off. His 
only real competition is Hillary Clinton, who has proven herself to be a 
crooked and corrupt politician; any third-party candidate currently running 
for president stands no chance of actually winning. 


Donald Trump is nowhere near as bad as people think he is. Despite popular 
belief, he is not going to lead our country into an era of racism, sexism, 
xenophobia, or hate. Sure, he has said some pretty offensive things, but 
that just shows that he is an actual person who does not try to be 
politically correct in order to just win the vote. We have all said things 
that we regret or did not mean, and that makes us human. Politicians like 
Hillary Clinton have said things almost as bad as what Trump has said, but 
only in private. For example, as much as people like to point to out that 
Donald Trump has accused President Barack Obama of being born in Kenya, it 
was a Clinton employee who first suggested it. According to Joshua 
Muravchik in “Hillary Clinton’s Bad Old Days”, “Clinton-family retainer 
Sidney Blumenthal had furnished the material on Obama’s past” (34). Clinton 
is unreliable and has crooked ways, as she now claims to support Obama.


Hillary Clinton’s corruption as a politician is also demonstrated by the 
way that she can be “bought”. Many people believe that she is nothing more 
than a puppet for large corporations and rich people that donate to her 
foundation. As Sam Frizell points out in “The Benefits of Friendship with 
Hillary Clinton”, “half the private individuals whom Clinton met with… 
donated to the foundation. That’s 85 out of 154 people” (5). This 
contradicts a Clinton quote that Frizell also brings to attention, 
“‘Democracy can't just be for billionaires’” (6). Donald Trump is a 
billionaire who worked throughout his life to get to this point, and will 
not be easily bought, as he is not hungry for the money. The same can not 
be said for Hillary. 


I understand why so many people are reluctant to give Donald Trump a 
chance. He’s a loudmouth who lacks political experience, but compared to 
Hillary, he is safe. He has proven that he understands the economy with the 
fact that he has done so well, and he has policies that could help our 
country. Many people may be put off by what Trump has said about some 
things, such as illegal immigrants, and his idea of “building a wall” to 
keep them from coming into the United States. Those people just 
misunderstand though, as Trump claims in his book Crippled America: How to 
Make America Great Again, “I don’t want to stop legal immigration to this 
country. In fact, I would like to reform and increase immigration in some 
important ways” (29). I believe that many of his other policies may be 
misunderstood as well, but in time, if he becomes president, we will see 
that he has what is best for our country in mind. In regard to those voting 
for a third-party candidate, you are just wasting your vote. Your 
frustration with both major candidates is understandable, but please think 
about which of them will be better for our country, as you could be making 
a huge mistake by not voting for them. Donald Trump is not the only the 
most fit candidate for presidency, but perhaps the only fit candidate.",0.0488963049212,0.136539325345

2434,"Trump is like poison. Trump supporters like him because of a few reasons



1) People were so afraid of being rude and racist to others because they 
could get in trouble or hurt, but now since there is a popular racist rich 
guy, they can let everything out.

2) He owns a million dollar company. People think that with money he can do 
anything and it's true, he can bribe ANYONE into doing ANYTHING. 

3) He goes against all the stereotypes. Because of vines and websites, 
everyone has a specific thought on a person or race. Trump takes advantage 
of this and makes people hate and be afraid of these people. This helps him 
on his way to build a wall and deport millions of people. 

4) He only talks about immigrants and why Hillary is bad while Hillary 
talks about the countries status and future. But with all trump has said, 
he has made people hate Hillary.

Now the reasons why he would be. A bad president. I know Hillary has made 
mistakes and has lied and said some things, but trump has made WAY MORE 
than Hillary. 

Trump goes to Mexico, makes the president trust him, (lie), comes back and 
rants about Mexico, He said he loves Mexicans, (lie), wants to deport them, 
he says women are great and he respect them, (lie), He later goes on and 
insults them and has have been recorded with sexual assaults and racism.

If he deports people, the economy will go way down since even though many 
jobs will be open for Americans, there won't be enough to fill in the gap 
left from the millions of people that got deported. Farms will no longer be 
occupied by Mexicans and immigrants, and helpers of American farmers since 
no one will want to do those jobs causing a major depletion of food. And 
since he will stop importing things from many countries including food, 
causing more food depletion. 

Also other countries will become over populated and will cause major 
problems with increased food production needed and with many buildings left 
in America after people abandoned them, there will be thousands of acres 
worth of land wasted.




Think of the future. You hold the fate of America and the world in your 
hands. Become a hero. Choose what is right. Vote for Hillary.

2435,"“Donald Trump is running for president.” I think we all had the same 
reaction when we heard this news but now we probably have some different 
views. Although we may disagree on many things I believe one thing we can 
agree on is that these are two of the worst candidates we’ve ever had in 
American history. 
I was 100% anti-Trump when he proposed his candidacy, but through following 
the election he seems to be the best option we have in 2016. Though he has 
said some extremely radical things, such as building a wall to keep illegal 
immigrants from coming across the border, that is not a bad idea. He is not 
saying he wants to deport ALL immigrants. Trump is just enforcing a law 
because it is in fact illegal to be in America ILLEGALLY.
“The current official unemployment rate for Hispanics is 9.1 percent, 
compared to 7.6 percent for the nation as a whole.” It is understandable 
for Donald Trump to be upset with these numbers because they are increasing 
our country as a whole’s numbers. Hispanic voters are mostly against the 
republican party but there are “new forces” who are fighting for 
immigration reform and fair treatment for Latinos. 46% of voters in a poll 
agree with this statement. Some people say this is morally wrong but if you 
look back to the Sedition Act of 1798 the federalists discouraged low life 
immigrants and wanted to grant president the right to deport the unwanted. 
With that being said these views are not a new idea to a person of 
political importance. 
CNN has caught Trump in some bad situation. Such as an audio recording 
where Trump speaks of his daughter’s breasts, three-way sex, and him not 
dating women older than 35. Also, caught on the recording was talk of him 
“barging” into beauty pageant dressing rooms. Trumps running mate, Mike 
Pence, says he is “distraught about all of Trumps doings.” Although this 
may be true his disrespect does not even amount to the torture and acts of 
malice toward women by Isis. Trump will still provide women with the same 
opportunities as others in a professional manner.",0.290204797197,-0.0854146377964

You have the choice between Trump, an unscrupulous Businessman and Clinton, 
a woman that did some very poor decisions during her life; but she is the 
only chance for America. Obama did something wrong, like any other 
president too, cause nobody's perfect, but he did steps into the right 
direction and Clinton can expand this. America is stronger together, 
America dont need someone who is trying to divide its people into Muslims, 
Hispanics and Americans. In my country, guns are prohibited and it works 
very well. We dont have a shoot-out in a public school every two months and 
that high amount of firearm deaths. Trump wants to keep his Citizens safe 
and create prosperity but he denies the gunfact. Clinton however tries like 
Obama too, to decrease the amount of weapons. In fact, if you elect Trump 
for the next 4 years, you have to life with the consequences, and not just 
you, the whole world has to deal with this decision. So, do yourself and 
the world a favor and vote for Clinton. Reality has no rewind

2465,"I am only 12 years old and this is my only off day and I'm spending my time 
looking at the presidential debate because I really want to understand 
what's going around in my world. people that vote for Donald Trump are just 
looking about how much money he has and I just probably bribed in some way 
, but Hillary Clinton will be the perfect person for the job. I don't know 
much about the presidential debate because I am so long but from what I 
hear I think Hillary Clinton is the best person for the job because she 
gets her point across and she's very thorough about how she will make 
America great again. people like Donald Trump are business owners and all 
they care about is money now I'm not saying that Donald Trump is in a good 
person in that doesn't his point across but he doesn't really focus on the 
topic.Now you can look at both sides Donald Trump wants to make it legal 
for anyone to be able to have a gun and he wants to build a wall to reduce 
the amount of immigration. Hillary Clinton wants back background checks on 
people when they are trying to purchase a gun for our safety as well as for 
kids and she wants to reduce the amount of poverty in America by making 
things more affordable especially when it comes to people that are able to 
afford for their children to go to college. I understand why Donald Trump 
is coming from when he wants to keep out people that will harm us but it 
still doesn't mean that people that have been here for hundreds and 
hundreds of years they should just go back to somewhere that wasn't either 
comfortable or a good position for their families. Hillary Clinton wants us 
all to be equal. the presidential debate is really confusing for someone my 
age but the only things that I take out of it is that Hillary Clinton will 
provide safety and money for people in need and for children. Hillary

State being more corrupt than any person to ever run for the Office of 
President Of The United States, it is and was inevitable that someone 
other than established politicians would run. It was also inevitable 
that they would win. Why you may ask? Or not. Because more and more 
citizens of this country have become disgusted with the way The United 
States is going. Progressives, eie the party of Woodrow Wilson, FDR, 
Truman ect did not and do not believe in the Constitution and Bill of 
Rights as a living and just as important document as it was in the 
founding of our country. Little by little, because we do not pay 
attention, we are having our freedoms taken from us. Our short attention
spans will be the destruction of our country as we have known it in the
past. Progressive thought is that the government not only should but 
has the right to involve itself in our live by taking responsibility for
things the Constitution and the Bill of Rights did not give it 
permission and in some cases out right forbid it to do or take. What we 
saw happen in this election is a direct response to a government out of 
control. Americans are waking up. It had to happen sooner or later and 
sooner is best. It is people like Sarah Trachtenburg that think that 
electing a 
person like Clinton is ok even if she is corrupt, a traitor, a betrayer 
of employees of her own department, Benghazi, even if she furthers her 
and Bill's own fortunes off of the relief funds headed to victims of 
terrible events in this world. Even if she has no care for slain 
Americans and can go before Congress and say, and I quote, ""What 
difference does it make."" And even if she can lie through her teeth and 
everyone knows she is lying through her teeth. Have you ever wondered 
why many people who have crossed her are no longer heard from or around?

to be president than Trump, so was Ted Cruz. Hell, even Jeb Bush was more 
qualified. What honestly made people believe that Trump was more qualified 
than the other Republican nominees?
Voters have said that Trump talks just the way they do. That's because 
Trump's not a politician just like most of the voters aren't. They don't 
know things work in office. And if Trump becomes president, he's going to 
find out the hard way how things work and is going to realize, very 
quickly, that he's in over his head and that running for president was a 
huge mistake. If Trump realizes that he's in over his head, he's not going 
to resign even if he's advised to because he'll tell his advisors, ""No, if 
I resign then everyone is going to know that I couldn't do this job and if 
that happens, my image will be ruined."" To people like Trump, their image

2641,"Leader Trump

When the word, “leader”, goes through your mind, do you think of a man or 
woman? Obviously, a woman can be just as or even more manly than a man can 
be. But image is very important to our enemies way of thinking which leads 
to their decisions. Trump is only going to do good things to our military 
and create a GREATLY, assertive image upon our threats. Security is a 
beautiful thing and will keep so much stress away from our minds.

With being president comes great power and with great power, Trump knows 
good and well about great responsibility. Donald Trump seems to have a good 
perspective of responsibility. He has already proven how responsible he is 
with his decision making as a business man. Just from impressions, it might 
seem that he makes risky decisions but within the past decades he hasn’t 
showed us anything but success and extreme productivity. Trump may be 
drastically different, but that also means that he is an ,outside of the 
box, thinker, for example, “He tends to buy properties that have less of an 
upside if they also are a safer choice (i.e., less downside).”.

America’s debt simply and literally needs conservation because of all of 
our investments being made in the last 2 terms. Trump is only bringing 
notice to the most effective problems that don't try to focus on as many 
people’s feelings as possible. He will not make ignorant decisions because 
he has gained more than he has lost from bankruptcy and gained an unlimited 
amount of resources to make him all around successful. Donald Trump has 
proven that he is active and willing to put in work because of his rapid 
amount of trial and error.

Every penny counts as Donald Trump just wants to save/make money along with 
growing our economy more efficiently than ever before. He has a plan to 
reduce most taxes. Trump is tremendously serious about calculations to set 
his goals higher than most people are ready for. Because of most people 
thinking that taxes are inevitable, they just assume that we will lose so 
much money if we cut them but if Trump becomes president I strongly believe 
that money will be one of the least of our worries.

Currently, among our peers and media, we see how Trump supporters just do 
not “fit in”. All the youngins these days just won’t open their mind up a 
little because they never imagined him and his different ideologies 
proceeding in politics. Our fairly new generations don’t understand how 
Trump is the actual republican candidate. Our media has convinced so many 
people that Trump is the most unsophisticated choice, therefore, they also 
want to convince more people to not vote for Trump. This, of course, leads 
to making many republicans feel that Trump just can’t be an option because 
of the pressure other peers have put on them.",0.398360895214,-0.0893385230609

If you have any emotions as a human left, don't vote for trump. I am 
Hispanic and my parents came from Mexico because they had to look for a 
job. They were separated from their grand parents and parents for many 
years, and now their grandparents can't even come and visit us, not even my 
uncle! My parents will end up being deported leaving me, my sister and my 
pet helpless with no food, water, or money. I may very likely be spending 
my time living in my school. That's not all, over 5,000,000 kids will be 
left alone with no one to help them. Even if we do get help, we will still 
be separated from our loving parents. And over 300 people have said that 
they will commit suicide if trump wins. Not to mention the other deaths 
caused by homeless children and innocent immigrants who have lost 
everything they have worked for. My mom has worked for Allstate for 13 
years and has recently opened up her own agency with Allstate after 4 years 
of school, traveling, and work. My dad has helped many Americans with work 
and projects as well not criticize anyone even if they are racist, 
American, or African American. My mom tries to save lives and supports many 
organizations and has donated thousands of dollars to programs trying to 
save lives.Also think about it, Abraham Lincoln tried his best to keep this 
country together but got killed for his efforts.Martin Luther King Jr. not 
only helped fight for equal rights for African Americans, but Mexicans, 
Hispanics, Muslims, women, and other immigrants who were struggling getting 
a better life.Do you really want a president who is a racist jerk who only 
cares about his own personal gain? I do agree that there are some bad 
people that do some bad crimes, but you don't see trump putting all the 
American criminals and serial killers in jail! Choose what is right. The 
fate of America and millions of lives rests in your hands. You can be a 
hero or a villain. You hold the power. Choose what's right.

I'm 28 years old. Never voted in my life before this election. Why? I 
always felt that the candidates running were always similar to the ones 
running previously. Nothing ever stood out to me. Until this election.

Donald Trump absolutely has his flaws. Not wording things the right way, 
gets angry quick, acts childish, doesn't sound politically correct 
etc......... but i want you to watch him and take a good look at him in the 
past few months. Watch his demeanor. This is a man who doesn't need this 
position. A billionaire who can retire and live a very pleasant life. He 
spent over 100 million dollars so far, has been ridiculed and scorn by the 
media and still has the energy to attend 7 rallies in a day. Let me say 
that again SEVEN RALLIES IN A DAY!

Instead of piggybacking with the media and the celebrities, take a real 
good look at this mans work ethic. Look into his eyes and see the sincerity 
in them. Take a look at his family. My father once told me you can tell a 
lot about a man from his family. His family is respectful, they know that 
hard work brings great things and they know that together they are stronger.

Vote for Hillary if you want, but in the end all you will get with her is 
the same damn thing you got with Obama. Just another politician.

Take a chance with Donald J. Trump. Be unique in a room full of followers. 
Who cares if Lady Gaga or Bon Jovi Or Jay Z backs her for God knows 
whatever reason. Be unique and stand up for what you truly believe in. I 
guarantee, what you believe in, is what Trump wants to make happen in this 
great country we call America.

picking the candidate which represents the ""lesser"" evil. Really? Why would 
we want to vote for evil at all? This debate rages, all the while we ignore 
the bigger evil/elephant in the room. We have brought this situation upon 
ourselves. Our Constitution begins with ""We the People.."" not They the 
Politicians. The current state of affairs, or the lack of a good political 
candidate is not the fault of any political party it is the fault of We the 
People. We have become lazy and complacent. We don't want to have to work 
to solve our problems we would rather give them to someone else along with 
the power and authority. We are so complacent in letting others take care 
of things we are even willing to give up our rights as guaranteed in the 
Constitution itself. We have turned Washington from a garden of democracy 
to a cesspool of decadence. America worked because We the People, as a 
whole, stood for something. We always took the higher road. You can't 
legislate morality, it must come from the society. A society that works and 
cares for its individuals. We no longer want to work for what we get 
material or otherwise, we want it handed to us. This sense of entitlement 
is destroying the fundamental principles used to build this country. We 
don't want to face problems in our communities, we want someone else to do 
that. We are even willing to let the state raise our children. It's time to 
wake up! We are the problem. We have become sheep. Why do we allow politics 
to become a career? Why don't we hold our representatives to the same 
higher moral code we want to tread? Why do we let the media tell us what is 
and is not correct? We the People should set the standards, We the People 
should wake up and start caring about our neighbors, our communities and 
our country. The Constitution of the United States is a divinely inspired 
document which paved the way for not only one great nation, but many which 
would follow in her footsteps. It should be the highest law in the land and 
should be our guide. Let's take a look in the mirror and face the real 
problem. We let ourselves deteriorate to this....So what are ""We the 
People"" going to do now? We must make wise decisions even if they are hard, 
not voting is a choice...one our children will have to live with.

motorcade accident occur almost simultaneously a few nights ago. I wonder 
whether the boisterous talk surround 2nd Amendment rights riles certain 
people up and gets in their heads the wrong way. That amendment shouldn't 
empower persons to rise up and do whatever comes to their minds simply 
because they feel they have some personal cause to defend. I feel in this 
21st Century era it is ripe time for the 2nd amendment to be reviewed for a 
possible rewriting so that people can receive it in its clarified intent. 
Upholding tradition is good but not so it binds the hands and feet. The 
founding fathers of the American Constitution shouldn't continue to have 
all the say on this for our times, neither a tiny minority hold any review 
process hostage causing lives to needlessly be lost. That certainly appears 
to be the root of home-grown terrorism.

Duel of the Doctors; final round! 

Between Donald, the Dentist (business mogul with honorary merits from the 
university of public opinion and high regard) vs.

Hillary, the Heart Surgeon (juris doctor too)

Specs: 

Donald pulls all kinds of teeth; Hillary could re-start hearts (provided 
that national healthcare doesn't get plucked out as well. Plus the great 
Secretary is generally conciliatory and diplomatic.

Donald is proud that he made himself rich in 'business' (using all the tax 
loopholes he could unearth along the way) but he claims Hillary made 
herself rich in 'politics' - which to him is low down and dirty. I am not 
sure why that should be objectionable and why the Secretary should not be 
able to live as well as the Donald himself. Furthermore I am of the opinion 
that Hillary rather used her wordsmith abilities and capabilities, her time 
and advice, being a learned woman of the law, added to all the fine hats 
she has worn that provided her with tremendously invaluable 
'stock-in-trade'. This should not be shameful or disdainful for anyone, I 
should think.

Donald with the many accusations and charges leveled at him from every 
quarter for acts of discrimination, assaults, tax evasion plus (Seth 
Meyers' list on CNN's Don Lemon is most conclusive). But then the grand 
master - possible 'links' with Russian espionage where they have hacked 
U.S. information systems all around. In one breath Donald says he knows the 
Russian president, in another he says he doesn't (the tapes never lie). 
Talk about corruption? Forget the orange jumpsuit, in times past this would 
have been serious treason and downright treachery.

So what were all the suppositional claims and unsubstantiated steroid 
charges levied against the Secretary Clinton founded on again? Probably an 
attempt at comparing hers and Donald's own pristine record and stellar 
virtues. We know they are stellar because Donald has not admitted 
wrongdoing on any count in any matter.

Hopefully the results of this election finally concludes the official close 
of stone throwing season. Thank you, Jesus.",-0.0455172496737,0.157126474868

worth from what? Does she own a business? Does she produce anything? No, 
she is worth 250 million by playing politics and taking pay checks from 
special interests... 
A woman who no one trusts or has faith in, even her closest co workers. A 
woman that is known for being a raging alcoholic again among her closest 
comrades, who are quoted in the Wikileaks emails saying she doesn't even 
make it to 9 am before she is completely drunk. And people wonder why she 
keeps falling over and collapsing... It is called being drunk.
Are you people really so blind to her corruption? Wake up and quit being a 
simple minded idiot... do a bit of research before you make an obviously 
shallow comment. 

Follow Trump back and watch what he has been saying for 30 years, then 
follow Hillary back for 30 years and look at what she has not done while in 
a position to do so. 
There is a handful of people who really call the shots, people who by the 
way give no damn about me you or anybody. They want Hillary, if that is not 
obvious to you then this comment can not help you.

We literally spend an hour of mainstream time on a man jokingly saying some 
piggish things about woman. While spending less then a few minutes covering 
Hillary's deleting 33,000 emails after receiving a federal subpoena to not 
do exactly that...
A woman who is connected to people being paid 1500$ to go and insight 
violence.

Ohh my God did that GUY saying something piggish about a WOMAN!??!?? OH MY 
GOD ARREST THAT MAN!

But wait, that woman over there broke the law about 57 million times and 
was responsible for inciting violence that actually got people hurt in real 
life as opposed to a joke that took place in a guys mind....

Ohh thats no big deal, the guy is definitely the bad guy here... you anti 
Trump people are silly.",-0.0802769144814,-0.0293842824936

Crony capitalism, ignorance to sustainable development, mesmerizing words

supply plenty of flattering words to ordinary people, but all resources 
will go to big fishes only), rigorous campaigns to suppress people's

would be their blind followers with no genuine personal opinions, They 
justify inhuman activities, they are intolerant to minorities and they 
don't intend to uphold humanity. My opinion is.. The responsibility of 
government to take care of it's citizens cannot be handed over to profit 
minded private players. Civilised society is like a tree, reforms should 
pour on top like photosynthesis, Resources should flow from the bottom like 
water and soil nutrients, The tree will become weak if all resources are 
artificially concentrated on the fruits directly. The roots have to grow so 
that the entire tree becomes independent. Although Trump is more likely to 
support India than Clinton, I know very well, choosing an evil's attractive

I prefer trump because even through he's too instinctively ,but he is a 
strong and successful business man ,instinctively is not big trouble to be 
leader, I don't like Clinton ,the main reason is she always talks 
everythins about policy as machine , for instance : I would set up no-fly 
zone for some chaos zone.

reduce deficit for government and so so , but these cases are just 
“cases”,what's reason for case??? How are your actions going to solve 
cases??? Any possible to be worse ? how do you certain your actions is 
strong and thorough to fix trouble , I never see her try to comment that .

in the world Starbucks etc., money does not trickle down it goes on a

last is where i would spend it if i lived in the USA, Macdonalds, 
Smithfeilds, etc., my money goes straight back up to the richest men in the 
world, it does not trickle down. These big industries need to be taxed as 
they used to be in days when the well fare state was the fashion. 
The government pays out the money which it takes in taxes to teachers, 
those who work building roads and other public works schols hospitals, to 
doctors and nurses, while the money of the small man get spent with Steve 
Jobs or Bill Gates, goes straight back to the richest men in the world. It 
is governments which can change the enormouse, more or less monopolies that 
take all the money in the world, not the man on the street trying not to

monopolies and it is a change in economic policies that changes that and

people have graduated from college. they are no longer dependents under 
their parents. they are stacked high with student loan debt so they can't 
afford credit cards and business loans or get jobs or apartments or 
anything like that for themself. what they have is a high school degree. a 
diploma. and transcripts.and social media. but the registers in the retail 
stores don't work like that. we can't let the polls in the voting locations 
work like that. so, then how do those people register to vote? and how do 
they vote. they were studying in school some in state some out of state 
they don't have a home because even if they return to their parent's home 
they are not the owner of their parents home they are just a lodger they 
might as well use a hotel address as their address for voter registration 
purposes. they don't have any money that can purchase real property, a car 
a house an apartment, so what can they do. the bush administration utilized 
military families. they utilized the war in iraq and afgghanistan and the 
absantee ballot. so, naturally there was a question and confusion of votes 
being lost in the process or votes not being counted or paper versus 
electronic votes. the clinton administration used a lot of social service 
footprints necessary to repair the war crimes of the kennedy and reagan and 
bush administrations and vietnam wars and so and so forth. so, now we are 
in a difficult position. because we have social media. and, the purpose of 
social media is to negate the lies that big business or big corporations 
were feeding us in the media in order to affect politics. the media would 
say that it is going to rain today and when a person looks outside and sees 
that it is a sunny day without a cloud in sight , then it is the recording 
of that proof on social media that ultimately saves the false accusation. 
so, within this election, unfortunately, whatever the outcome, because the 
country is in a tender point economically and politically, we don't have 
the luxury of not having a sitting president. so, the effort is not in 
whether this party or that party or this person or that person wins or 
loses. rather, it is to make sure that neither either one of our candidates 
who is determined the winner and thus the next president of the united 
states falls, and that this country its economy and political system and so 
forth should too also not fall.",-0.147312012893,-0.120467185803
